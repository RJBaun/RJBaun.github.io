            During my time with Galon Insurance (now HUB International) I began
            as an office assistance. Within 2 years of my hire date I was
            promoted to a leadership role with up to 30 direct reports over two
            locations. While acting as manager, I successfully achieved and
            maintained revenue growth in excess of $110,000 per fiscal year,
            largely through implementing new processes for existing commercial
            clients to create a tailored experience and new revenues.

          To assist with the costs of tuition while in University, I started a
          snow removal company that grew to include a partner and two employees.
          The experience was very beneficial given my field of study, as I was
          solely responsible for all aspects of the business. Our portfolio
          included up to 23 properties and net profit over three seasons was
          approximately $10,000.
