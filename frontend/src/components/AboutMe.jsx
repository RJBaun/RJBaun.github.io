      </a>
      <p>Prior to taking the leap of faith into the world of programming, I have worked to establish an eclectic list of employment and educational experiences. Each experience I have been lucky enough to partake in has left me with a strong array of both hard and soft skills; I am a passionate professional with exceptional communication, problem solving, and work ethic. Above all, I have shown my consistent ability to take on new challenges and excel in environments I was previously unfamiliar with. 
        Below you can find a list of my most recent and significant undertakings.</p>
